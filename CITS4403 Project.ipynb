    "### Growth Grid\n",
    "This section contains an implementation of a Cellular Automata (CA) that models 'growth' from a starting spot on a grid. As the CA 'grows', it expands in a circular-like pattern and stores the distance travelled to reach each visited cell. Distance in this implementation includes the cost of travelling over terrain. Growth can re-explore already visited cells if a shorter path is found and eventually guarantee each cell has the shortest distance possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Concept for the Growth-Step Process\n",
    "The process of growth is theoretically a CA with local state and local rule-based interactions only. The process for each step can be decribed with the rules below:\n",
    "- Neighbour Rule: cell only updates if they are next to a cell with 'growth' in it.\n",
    "- Circle-Growth Rule: cell updates if they not yet visited and within the circular growth pattern.\n",
    "    - based on starting cell coordinates, current cell position coordinates and growth radius.\n",
    "        - starting cell coordinates propagated to all cells in 'growth'.\n",
    "        - current cell coordinates incremented from previous cell's coordinates.\n",
    "        - growth radius incremented from neighbouring cell with lowest growth_radius (starting cell has growth_radius of 0).\n",
    "- Distance Rule: all visited cells update distance based on lowest distance neighbour\n",
    "    - cell distance is distance of visited neighbouring cell with lowest distance + terrain value of current cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these rules to work, the terrain values for each cell must be greater than 0 to ensure that distance always increases during growth. This is important for path-finding (implemented later in the notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once no more neighbours can be updated, the grid contains the accumulated distance to each cell from the start. This is effectively the greedy search component of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a CA. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Growing in a circle\n",
    "The implementation of this CA uses the method `circle_neighbours()` to filter neighbours of a cell so that the growth to neighbours achieves a global circle pattern. The exact pattern is determined by `circle_type`, which is set at instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `circle_type = \"approx\"` then all neighbours in a 'von-neumann' neighbourhood (4-neighbourhood) are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `circle_type = \"true\"`, neighbours in a \"moore\" neighbourhood (8-neighbourhood) are filtered based on the euclidean distance from the starting spot. The filter only returns neighbours with euclidean distances less than the current number of steps, thus resulting in a circle with radius equal to the number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The euclidean distance from the starting spot ($centre$) to a $neighbour$ is calculated with the formula below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} distance = \\sqrt{(centre[x] - neighbour[x])^2 + (centre[y] - neighbour[y])^2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of the Growth-Step Process\n",
    "The implementation is not a pure CA, as some changes have been made to make the `step()` method more space and time efficient. For example, the starting cell coordinates are not stored by all cells and is stored globally in the `centre_coords` attribute, since it stays the same for each cell in the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation also memoises the cells that were updated in the previous step - or the edge of growth - in the `_edge_indicies` attribute. The neighbours of these are then explored, instead of all cells and their neighbours being explored. this reduces computation needed to find cells that meet the CA rules of growth, especially considering the relatively small amount of updatable cells in each step.\n"
