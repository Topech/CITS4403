    "### Growth Grid\n",
    "This section contains an implementation of a Cellular Automata (CA) that models 'growth' from a starting spot on a grid. As the CA 'grows', it expands in a circular-like pattern and stores the distance travelled to reach each visited cell. Distance in this implementation includes the cost of travelling over terrain. Growth can re-explore already visited cells if a shorter path is found and eventually guarantee each cell has the shortest path possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Concept for the Growth-Step Process\n",
    "The process of growth is theoretically a CA with local state and local rule-based interactions only. The process for each step can be decribed with the rules below:\n",
    "- Neighbour Rule: cell only updates if they are next to a cell with 'growth' in it.\n",
    "- Circle-Growth Rule: cell updates if they not yet visited and within the circular growth pattern.\n",
    "    - based on starting cell coordinates, current cell position coordinates and growth radius.\n",
    "        - starting cell coordinates propagated to all cells in 'growth'.\n",
    "        - current cell coordinates incremented from previous cell's coordinates.\n",
    "        - growth radius incremented from neighbouring cell with lowest growth radius (starting spot has growth_radius of 0).\n",
    "- Distance Rule: all visited cells update distance based on lowest distance neighbour\n",
    "    - cell distance is distance of visited neighbouring cell with lowest distance + terrain value of current cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these rules to work, the terrain values for each cell must be greater than 0 to ensure that distance always increases during growth. This is important for path-finding (implemented later in the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules have no randomness, thus the CA is deterministc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once no more neighbours can be updated, the grid is considered at equilibrium and contains the accumulated distance to each cell from the start. This is effectively the greedy search component of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a CA. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Growing in a circle\n",
    "The implementation of this CA uses the method `circle_neighbours()` to filter neighbours of a cell so that the growth to neighbours achieves a global circle pattern. The exact pattern is determined by `circle_type`, which is set at instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `circle_type = \"approx\"` then all neighbours in a 'von-neumann' neighbourhood (4-neighbourhood) are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `circle_type = \"true\"`, neighbours in a \"moore\" neighbourhood (8-neighbourhood) are filtered based on the euclidean distance from the starting spot. The filter only returns neighbours with euclidean distances less than the current number of steps, thus resulting in a circle with radius equal to the number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The euclidean distance from the starting spot ($centre$) to a $neighbour$ is calculated with the formula below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} distance = \\sqrt{(centre[x] - neighbour[x])^2 + (centre[y] - neighbour[y])^2} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation of the Growth-Step Process\n",
    "The implementation is not a pure CA, as some changes have been made to make the `step()` method more space and time efficient. For example, the starting cell coordinates are not stored by all cells and is stored globally in the `centre_coords` attribute, since it stays the same for each cell in the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation also memoises the cells that were updated in the previous step - or the edge of growth - in the `_edge_indicies` attribute. The neighbours of these are then explored, instead of all cells and their neighbours being explored. this reduces computation needed to find cells that meet the CA rules of growth, especially considering the relatively small amount of updatable cells in each step.\n"

    "### Paths and Path-Finding\n",
    "This section outlines a class for finding the shortest path though a grid of accumulated distances, as provided by the `Circle_Growth_Grid` instance in the `distance_grid` parameter for the `find_shortest_path_from()` method. This can be used to find a path once the `distance_grid` is adjacent to the coordinates of the `start_spot` parameter, though the path can only be guaranteed to be optimal once the `distance_grid` is at equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The implementation\n",
    "The implemented solution currently is not designed as a cellular automata and requires the complete dataset from the `distance_grid` parameter to calculate the optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is based on dijkstra's algorithm, with the `distance_grid` providing the result of the greedy search throughout the currently explored cells. This is implemented as a depth-first search starting at the location indicated by the `start_spot` parameter for the method `find_shortest_path_from()`. The stack used is flawed - as it can only guarantee that the neighbour with the lowest distance is explored next, effectively forcing depth-first serarch. Dijkstra's algorithm usually uses a priority queue, which would guarantee that the cell in the stack with the lowest distance - regardless of when it was added to the stack - would have priority to be explored. Therefore, the current implementation cannot guarantee the optimal path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could explore the distance_grid memoising the prior cell, thus providing the shortest path without having to explore the `distance_grid`. This could provide a solution that could be implemented as a CA by simply following the stored prior cell to the start cell, at the cost of increased storage demands."

    "# Slime Mould Cellular Automata Model\n",
    "This section outlines a model of slime which uses a combination of `Circle_Growth_Grid` instances and `Slime_Path` instances together to implement a slime-mould-inspired CA model, which iteratively finds the shortest paths between spots as the slime 'grows'. \n",
    "\n",
    "This model aims to find the lowest-cost path in a spatial grid, considering the cost of travel. Using a deterministic CA provides the opportunity to create a solution that can scale up with parrallel computing. This could allow for faster computation of shortest paths across terrain, thereby increasing the potential resolution of data that may be explored in a reasonable time. The current implementation does not currently meet this aim since not all components are implemented as a CA, such as the `Slime_Path` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each spot imported through the `add_spot()` method and is provided its own `Circle_Growth_Grid` instance called `distance_grid`. A starting spot from the added spots must be chosen through the `set_start()` method for the `step()` method to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `Step()` Method\n",
    "Each step is split into the 'growth' phase and the 'path-finding' phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Growth phase\n",
    "In the 'growth' phase, the model will step all `distance_grids` of spots that are in the `found_spots` set. At first, only the starting spot is in this set, and thus is the only spot that is growing in the growth phase. Spots are added to `found_spots` once the `distance_grid` grows to the location of that spot, and consequently begin to grow as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Growing only when found is a legacy feature which was implemented before terrain was included. Before terrain, the path to a spot found would be a straight line. another legacy feature is keeping growths 'in sync', which is implemented in the `_circle_growth_syncer()` method. This legacy feature would only grow spots with the lowest `step_count`, until all growths 'synced' and had the same `step_count`. Thus, growing spots as found and keeping growths 'in sync' would guarantee that the first growth to bridge between spots provided the shortest path within the network of spots. Path-finding was trivially implemented as a CA, as a `distance_grid` with an equal terrain only requires following the 'steepest gradient' toward the centre of the growth, without having to worry about local minima. Implementing this in a CA was simply choosing the neighbour with the the lowest distance until the centre of growth is found. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once terrain was added, these legacy features provided little to no benefit, since the optimal path starting at a spot can only be guaranteed once the spot's `distance_grid` has reached equilibrium. Therefore, a spot growing to another spot first does not indicate that it has the lowest cost path, but only that the spots are spatially closest together. The path-finding had to be re-worked to avoid local-minima which was achieved through Dijkstra's algorithm used in the `Slime_Path` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path-finding phase\n",
    "After the growth phase in each step, the path-finding phase finds all paths to spots that have been found. The paths start at the centre of growth that found it and take the currently lowest cost path to the found spot. This path is only updated if a shorter path exists, which is indicated when the distance for a spot changes in a `distance_grid`.\n"
